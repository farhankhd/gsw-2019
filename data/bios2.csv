Paula,Mendoza,"Paula Mendoza is a Colombian designer, the founder and creator of New York based brand Paula Mendoza Jewelry, a creative director of Cano Jewelry and Co-Founder and Creative Director of Humanity of Looking for the Masters.
Her recognizable circular designs are not only a trend in her jewelry but also in the way she has run her business for more than 17 years. 
In terms of aesthetics, Paula utilizes the circle as a prominent component in each of her collections. For her the circle is representative of the balance between cause and effect as well as the shape of femininity. ""what you get is what you put out there in the universe""
From the beginning, Paula has worked with Colombian artisans to bring her designs to life. It is these artisans that she first started working with that continue to be part of the Paula Mendoza circle – creating an intimate family whose handcrafted work, not only established this brand but has created an ethos of social responsibility for the country of Colombia and added to its richness. Despite her inherent creative drive to design, Paula studied social communications. Realizing this was not the platform she wanted to utilize to express herself, she opens her first Atelier in Bogota, Colombia in 2003. A year later she moves to Washington, DC and establishes private clients where her circular designs quickly gained popularity. With a desire to take her designs to new heights, she studies Jewelry as Sculpture at the Corcoran Art Institute. Because of this course, Paula’s designs become ergonomic and form functioning to the body. Mixing the unparalleled craftsmanship of the Colombian artisans and her innovative approach to design won the attention of retailers and the media. Upon establishing New York as her headquarters 8 years ago, her brand has made it to the most reputable retailers worldwide such as Net-A-Porter, Saks, Moda Operandi, Harvey Nichols and Bergdorf Goodman, among others. Today Paula is also the creative Director of one of the most important jewelry house in Colombia - CANO jewelry and also it is Co-Founder and director of Humanity of Looking for the Masters, a project that looks to work with artisans and indigenous communities in order to preserve our history.
From the beginning, Paula consciously decided to have her country not only as source of inspiration but also as the source of production. Every material found in her pieces are locally sourced in as well as conflict free.
This ranges from the gold that is used to plate the pieces to the raw Emeralds that symbolize Colombia’s richness. Paula’s jewelry is recognized as not only physically sustainable but economically sustainable since the brand provides jobs to over 40 artisan families. 
It is because of this economic sustainability that Paula has been recognized by her country’s president Juan Manuel Santos as one of the 100 Top Colombians changing the face of the country.
This award acknowledges Paula’s sustainable fashion and the philanthropic energy that encompasses the essence of her and her brand. The DNA of this brand not only is a symbol for social responsibility but it is Paula’s outlet to demonstrate that kindness and success are not mutually exclusive. For the brand has proven that an entrepreneurial spirit and respect for others can still create art with meaning. Because of all that embodies the brand the brand.",N,Paula Mendoza,Ms.,"Designer & Founder, Paula Mendoza Jewelry",Panelist,N,U,paula.jpg,,,
